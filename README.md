1. Base_CREATE_DATASET: is python program that generates a dataset using simulation 
                        - meant for people who want to practice ML code on simulated datasets but do not want to go through the pain of generating a dataset from scratch
                        - simply call the create_dataset() function - answer a few basic questions that the program asks - and you have your dataset ready in a neat Pandas DataFrame format
